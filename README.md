This project displays an assortment of   d3.js charts written in react.js and is also es6. I have used D3.js for mainly the calculations and react is  used to render the views. The main goal of this project was for me to understand the flexibility of  D3.js and React.js in respect to interpreting designs, infographics and animations.  Treat these as proof of concepts.
